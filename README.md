# NomicVotes

### Command: !vote [topic] yourVote

Used to save your vote for a topic. You probably want to do this in a private message to the bot to keep it secret. 

The topic is not required, and is used as a category for the vote. 
The topic can be any name, like 311 for proposal 311 or 209judgement for voting on a judgement concerning rule 209.


The topic and yourVote cannot have spaces in them. 
Voting without a topic will save your vote to the default topic named current. 
If you've already voted, voting again will update your old vote. 


Examples:
*!vote yes
*!vote no
*!vote 311 yes
*!vote 209judgement no

### Command: !myvotes
